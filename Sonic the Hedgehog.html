        <b>Sonic the Hedgehog</b> [b] is a 2020 action-adventure comedy film based on the video game franchise of the same name published by Sega. The film is directed by Jeff Fowler (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Pat Casey and Josh Miller. It stars Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog and Jim Carrey as Doctor Robotnik, as well as James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, Natasha Rothwell, Adam Pally, and Neal McDonough. In the film, Sonic teams up with local town sheriff Tom Wachowski to find his lost rings and escape Dr. Robotnik.

Development for a film began in the 1990s, but did not go beyond the planning stage until Sony Pictures acquired the film rights in 2013. Production involved the collaboration of Sega Sammy's Japanese studio Marza Animation Planet, with Fowler brought in to direct in 2016. After Sony put the project in turnaround, Paramount Pictures acquired it in 2017. The majority of the cast signed on by August 2018, and principal filming took place between September and October that year in Vancouver and on Vancouver Island. Following the negative reaction to the first trailer in 2019, the film's release was delayed by three months to redesign Sonic.

Sonic the Hedgehog premiered at the Paramount Pictures studio lot on January 25, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 14, 2020. Critics praised the performances (particularly that of Schwartz and Carrey), Sonic's character design and animation, visual effects, action scenes, and its faithfulness to the source material, but criticized its story for its perceived lack of originality.[11][12] The film set the record for the biggest opening weekend for a video game film in the United States and Canada. It grossed over $308 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 2020 and the highest-grossing video game film adaptation of all time in North America. A sequel is scheduled for 2022.

        <u><b>Plot</b></u>
        On a distant planet, Sonic, a blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds, finds himself sought after by a tribe of echidnas for his power. His guardian, Longclaw the Owl, gives him a bag of rings that open portals to other planets. She uses one to send him to Earth while she fends off the echidnas. Ten years later, Sonic enjoys a secret life near the town of Green Hills, Montana, but longs to make friends. He idolizes the local sheriff, Tom Wachowski, and his veterinarian wife, Maddie, unaware the pair are planning to relocate to San Francisco soon, as Tom has been hired by the San Francisco Police Department.

One night, Sonic becomes upset over his loneliness when playing baseball by himself, and runs at supersonic speed as a result, inadvertently triggering an electromagnetic pulse that causes a power outage across the Pacific Northwest. Roboticist and scientific genius Dr. Robotnik is enlisted by the United States Department of Defense to uncover the source of the outage. Robotnik discovers and tracks Sonic, who hides in the Wachowskis' shed. Tom discovers Sonic and shoots him with a tranquilizer dart, causing Sonic to drop his bag of rings through a portal to San Francisco. Tom reluctantly agrees to help Sonic before Robotnik arrives at the Wachowskis' house and the two flee. As the pair evade Robotnik, who labels Tom a domestic terrorist, they slowly bond, with Tom learning about Sonic's desire for a real friend.

Having discovered one of Sonic's quills, Robotnik discovers the power in it has the potential to fuel his robots and becomes obsessed with capturing Sonic. As he tracks them down, Tom discusses his plans to leave Green Hills, and Sonic disapproves. Shortly after defeating a robot sent by Robotnik, an explosion injures Sonic. Arriving in San Francisco, Tom brings him to Maddie, who revives him. While Tom explains their situation to Maddie, Sonic receives a new pair of sneakers from Maddie's niece. The group soon head to the tower's roof of the Transamerica Pyramid, where Sonic's bag of rings landed, and recover them. Robotnik arrives in a hovercraft and attacks them, forcing Sonic to use a ring to send Tom and Maddie back to Green Hills.

Sonic flees from Robotnik, who uses the power of Sonic's quill to match his speed. The two engage in a chase across the world, ultimately returning to Green Hills. Robotnik incapacitates Sonic, but Tom intervenes, allowing Sonic to regain his strength and reclaim his lost energy. Overcoming Robotnik, Sonic defeats him by sending him to a mushroom planet. Following the incident, Tom and Maddie decide to stay in Green Hills and let Sonic live with them. The government erases all evidence of the events, including records of Robotnik's existence. Meanwhile, Robotnik, still in possession of Sonic's quill, begins plotting his revenge.

In a mid-credits scene, Tails, a fox from Sonic's world, emerges from a ring portal in search of Sonic.

        <u><b>Productin</b></u>Development for a film adaptation of the Sonic the Hedgehog video games began in 1993 during production of DIC Entertainment's television show Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog. Michealene Risley, the newly appointed consumer products director who helped license the character for Adventures, negotiated with several Hollywood producers. Sega CEO Tom Kalinske, however, was wary of damaging the brand and deemed it unacceptable, citing the commercial and critical failures of the Super Mario Bros. and Street Fighter films. Despite Kalinske's concerns, Sega was enthusiastic about a film adaptation. In August 1994, Sega struck a development deal with MGM and Trilogy Entertainment Group, with Pen Densham as the executive producer of the film.[26]

MGM and Sega hired Richard Jefferies, an associate of Risley from her days at Marvel Comics, to write a film treatment. At the time, Sega was developing Sonic X-treme (which was cancelled in late 1996) for its next console, the Sega Saturn, and asked Jefferies to feature the Saturn in the screenplay. Jefferies' treatment, entitled Sonic the Hedgehog: Wonders of the World, was submitted in May 1995. While the draft received a positive response among MGM and Sega executives, Sega COO Shinobu Toyoda suggested Kalinske replace Robotnik with a meaner villain. MGM canceled the project after a failed attempt to revive the film at DreamWorks, Jeffries suggested that the film was scrapped as both Sega and MGM wanted a higher share of the profits, while Densham said it followed creative differences between Sega and Trilogy.[26]

In 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired the rights to produce and distribute a film based on Sonic the Hedgehog.[27] On June 10, 2014, a live-action animated film was announced as a joint venture between Sony Pictures and Marza Animation Planet, a Japan-based subsidiary of Sega Sammy Group who had produced pre-rendered cutscenes for several Sonic the Hedgehog games.[28] It would be produced by Neal H. Moritz by his Original Film banner alongside Takeshi Ito, Mie Onishi, and Toru Nakahara, and written by Evan Susser and Van Robichaux.[28] In February 2016, Sega CEO Hajime Satomi said the film was scheduled for 2018.[29] Blur Studio's Tim Miller and Jeff Fowler were hired in 2016 to develop it; Fowler would make his feature directorial debut, and Miller and Fowler would executive produce; Blurr Studio previously produced CGI cutscenes for the videogames Shadow the Hedgehog (2005) and Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), with Fowler directing the cutscenes for the former.[30] Patrick Casey, Josh Miller, and Oren Uziel were writing the screenplay, while Casey and Miller wrote the story.[30][31]

On October 2, 2017, Paramount Pictures announced that they had acquired the rights after Sony put the film in turnaround. Almost all of the production team remained unchanged and intact.[32] In February 2018, it was announced that the film would be released in November 2019.[33][34]

Early drafts for the film featured Sonic's "Super Sonic" form from the video games. However, the ideas was discarded, as Fowler felt "it didn't make sense to obviously bring in the Super Sonic thing just yet,” and wanted the film to focus on the origins of Sonic and Robotnik's relationship.[35] Early drafts also featured more scenes in Sonic's world, with Tails being presented as Sonic's best friend in his world.[36] Another draft also featured Tails as a main character in the film. However, Tails' role was eventually reduced to a cameo in a post-credits scene when the filmmakers choose to develop the story around Sonic being alone on Earth, and choose to instead use Tails in order to tease a potential sequel.[36]
