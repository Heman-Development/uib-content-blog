# Build a blog
- create an `index.html` page and a `posts` directory containing your blog posts
- inside the posts directory create a HTML file for each post, for example `post-1.html`, `post-2.html` etc. Create at least 3 posts.
- in the index.html, list all the posts available, showing the main picture, title, and the first few lines of content. At the end, put a `read more` link that points to the full blog post
- inside each one of the post page, put the main image, the title, the full content and some extra images
- add a link to the post page to go back to the home

Notes:
- copy the content from some wikipedia page, or from whatever you prefer, but try to give it a theme. Some ideas:
    - a blog about your favourite video games
    - a blog about your favourite tv series
    - a blog about your favourite cartoons or anime
    - a blog about comics
    - a blog about your favourite bands
    - you got the idea
- try to use as many things you learned as possile
    - put some floating image in the text
    - add some background color
    - some colored links
- use the examples below as a reference, but try to come up with your own style ideas
