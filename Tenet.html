        <b> Tenet</b> ‚is a 2020 action-thriller and science fiction film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who produced it with Emma Thomas. A co-production between the United Kingdom and United States, it stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Dimple Kapadia, Michael Caine, and Kenneth Branagh. The plot follows a secret agent (Washington) as he manipulates the flow of time to prevent World War III.

Nolan took more than five years to write the screenplay after deliberating about Tenet's central ideas for over a decade. Pre-production began in late 2018, casting in March 2019, and principal photography lasted three months in Denmark, Estonia, India, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and United States, from May to November. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot on 70 mm and IMAX. Scenes of time manipulation were filmed both backwards and forwards. Upwards of one hundred vessels and thousands of extras were used.

Delayed three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tenet was released in the United Kingdom on August 26, 2020, and United States on September 3, 2020, in IMAX, 35 mm, and 70 mm. It was the first Hollywood tent-pole to open in theaters after the pandemic shutdown, and has grossed $353 million worldwide, making it the fourth highest-grossing film of 2020. Tenet received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances, production value, and visuals, though some criticized the sound mixing and complex plot.

        <u><b>Plot</b></u>
        An unnamed CIA agent, the "Protagonist", participates in an undercover operation at a Kyiv opera house. He is aided by a masked soldier with a distinctive trinket, who appears to "un-fire" a bullet through a hostile gunman. After seizing a strange artifact, the Protagonist is captured by mercenaries. He endures torture before consuming a cyanide pill. He awakens to learn the pill was a test of his loyalty; his team has been killed and the artifact lost.

  The Protagonist is now employed by a secret organization called Tenet. A scientist shows him bullets with "inverted" entropy which allows them to move backwards through time. She believes they are manufactured in the future, and a weapon exists that can wipe out the past. Aided by a local contact, Neil, the Protagonist traces the bullet cartridges to arms dealer Priya Singh. He discovers she is a member of Tenet; her cartridges were purchased and time-inverted by Russian oligarch Andrei Sator.

  The Protagonist approaches Sator's estranged wife Kat, an art appraiser who unknowingly sold Sator a forged Goya drawing. Sator uses the drawing to blackmail her and keep her under his control. The Protagonist plots to steal the drawing with Neil from Freeport, a facility in Oslo Airport. There, they find a machine, a "turnstile", and fend off two masked men. Priya explains that the turnstile can invert the entropy of objects and people, and that the masked men were the same person.

  In the Amalfi Coast, Kat introduces the Protagonist to Sator, but learns that the drawing is intact. The three go boating and Kat attempts to drown Sator, but the Protagonist saves him. The Protagonist offers to help Sator retrieve a case he says contains Plutonium-241. In Tallinn, the Protagonist and Neil ambush an armoured convoy and steal the case, which contains the artifact lost in Kyiv. They are ambushed by an inverted Sator, who holds Kat hostage. The Protagonist gives Sator an empty case and he retreats. The Protagonist saves Kat, but is captured and taken to Sator's warehouse.

  The inverted Sator shoots Kat with an inverted round, while the normal Sator demands the location of the artifact; the Protagonist gives him false information. Tenet operatives led by Ives rescue the Protagonist while Sator escapes. The group take Kat through Sator's turnstile to invert her, reversing the effect of the round. The Protagonist returns to the ambush site and chases Sator. His vehicle is overturned and Sator sets it on fire; the Protagonist is saved by Ives' team again. Neil reveals that he is a member of Tenet.

  The Protagonist and Neil travel back in time to Freeport. There, the Protagonist fights his past self and enters the turnstile to revert himself, followed by Neil and Kat. Priya explains that the artifacts are parts of an "algorithm", capable of catastrophically inverting the planet that Sator is assembling.


  Sator square, providing the film title, location of the opening sequence (Kyiv Opera), and character or firm names (A. Sator; Arepo the Goya forger; and Rotas Security in Oslo Freeport)[5]
  Kat reveals that Sator is dying from pancreatic cancer. He will trigger the algorithm with a dead man's switch, believing that the world should die with him. Kat believes Sator will kill himself during their vacation in Vietnam when they were last happy together. The Protagonist, Neil, Kat, and the Tenet forces invert back to that day so Kat can delay Sator's death while Tenet secures the algorithm.

  Tenet tracks the assembled algorithm to Sator's hometown of Stalsk-12 in Northern Siberia. In a "temporal pincer movement", red team troops move forward in time, while the blue team troops move backward. The Protagonist and Ives are aided by a masked corpse with a trinket on its backpack that returns to life. In Vietnam, Kat boards Sator's yacht and kills him as the Protagonist and Ives secure the algorithm.

  The Protagonist, Neil, and Ives break up the algorithm and part ways. The Protagonist notices a trinket on Neil's rucksack. Neil reveals that he was recruited by the Protagonist years earlier, and this mission is the end of a long friendship. Priya attempts to have Kat assassinated, but is killed by the Protagonist, who has realised that he is the future mastermind behind Tenet.

        <u><b>Production</b></u>
        Writer and director Christopher Nolan conceived the ideas behind Tenet over the course of twenty years,[21] but began working on the script in 2014.[8] The title is a palindrome and an allusion to the Sator Square.[8][22] Nolan made a conscious effort to abstain from any influence of the spy genre other than his own memory.[23] Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) inspired the screenwriting.[21] Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who worked with Nolan on Interstellar (2014), was consulted on the subjects of time and quantum physics.[24] Pre-production lasted from late 2018 until early 2019, leaving department heads five months to prepare.[8] Special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher watched World War II movies and documentaries to find reference points for realism.[25] Production designer Nathan Crowley requested Hamilton Watch Company to manufacture around thirty military wristwatches, each analog with a digital countdown.[26] Nolan and Crowley traveled to scout for locations in February and April 2019. Disappointed with the Royal Swedish Opera as a potential spot for the Kyiv Opera House, Crowley switched it to the Linnahall, which fit his affinity for Brutalist architecture. Shree Vardhan Tower was chosen instead of Antilia, as the latter had too high security; the National Liberal Club took the place of Sotheby's, whose management refused to participate; and they arrived at Cannon Hall once Thornhill Primary School in Islington and Channing School had been deemed unsatisfactory. Prop prototypes were often 3D printed. Costume designer Jeffrey Kurland and his team cut and stitched the clothing in the United States, manufacturing them for the main cast and thousands more.[8][27]
