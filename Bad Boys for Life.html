        <b>Bad Boys for Life</b> is a 2020 American action comedy film that is the sequel to Bad Boys II (2003) and the third installment in the Bad Boys trilogy. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reprise their starring roles in the film, which is
        directed by Adil & Bilall and written by Chris Bremner, Peter Craig and Joe Carnahan. The film's cast also includes Paola Núñez, Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig, Charles Melton, Kate del Castillo, Nicky Jam, and Joe Pantoliano. It was
        produced by Smith, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Doug Belgrad. In Bad Boys for Life, Miami detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett investigate a string of murders tied to Lowrey's troubled past.

        A third Bad Boys film was discussed after the success of the second, with Michael Bay stating he would be interested in returning to direct, but budgetary constraints made going ahead difficult. The film went through several attempts to enter
        production over the course of a decade, with a variety of writers and directors attached. The project was eventually finalized and green-lit in October 2018, and filming began the following year, lasting from January to June 2019. Principal
        photography took place in Atlanta, Miami, and Mexico City.

        Bad Boys for Life was theatrically released in the United States on January 17, 2020, by Sony Pictures Releasing through Columbia Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews[8] and grossed $426.5 million worldwide, making it the
        third highest-grossing film of 2020. It is also the highest-grossing installment of the series and the biggest January release of all-time.

        <u><b>Plot</b></u>
        Isabel Aretas, widow of cartel kingpin Benito, escapes from a Mexican prison with the aid of her son Armando. Isabel sends Armando to Miami, tasking him with recovering a substantial stash of money his father Benito had hidden, as well as
        assassinating the people responsible for his father's arrest and eventual death in prison. Isabel demands that Armando kill Miami detective Mike Lowrey last.

        In Miami, Mike accompanies his partner Marcus Burnett to the birth of his first grandson. Desiring to spend more time with his family, the aging Marcus tells Mike he intends to retire, to Mike's chagrin. During a party celebrating Marcus'
        grandson, Mike is shot by Armando and left in a coma for months. Chastised by Isabel for targeting Mike first, Armando continues to assassinate other targets on his list during Mike's convalescence.

        Following Mike's recovery, he is determined to seek revenge and unsuccessfully attempts to recruit the now-retired Marcus, causing a fall out between them. Mike violently obtains the identity of arms dealer Booker Grassie from an informant.
        Realizing that Mike will not heed orders to stay away from the investigation, Captain Howard reluctantly allows him to work with the tech-driven team in charge, the Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO), led by Mike's ex-girlfriend Rita.
        While the team surveils Grassie at an arms deal, Mike determines that the buyers intend to kill Grassie and intervenes, but fails to save him. Later, Marcus is called by Carver Remy, an old informant who believes the assassin is after him.
        Marcus contacts Mike and the pair travel to Carver, but are too late to save him. Armando escapes after a fistfight with Mike.

        Captain Howard later reveals his intentions to retire as well, offering advice to Mike that he needs to find a path forward in life. He is abruptly assassinated by Armando moments later. The captain's death pulls Marcus out of retirement, but
        he intends to work as a team with AMMO. They track down Grassie's accountant, who leads them to Lorenzo "Zway-Lo" Rodriguez. They infiltrate Zway-Lo's birthday party leading to a destructive car chase. Armando arrives in a helicopter to
        rescue Zway-Lo but kills him when he blocks Armando's ability to shoot the pursuing Mike. As he lines up a shot, Armando tells Mike "Hasta el fuego". Gunfire from Marcus creates cover for Mike, who falls into the water below.

        AMMO is shut down because of the failed operation. In private, Mike reveals to Marcus that Armando may be his son. Before partnering with Marcus, Mike worked as an undercover officer in the Aretas cartel where he met Isabel. They fell in love
        and intended to run away together, using "Hasta el fuego" as a made-up secret catchphrase. Mike ultimately remained loyal to the police, realizing how dangerous Isabel had become. Despite Mike's opposition, Marcus and AMMO join him in Mexico
        City to confront her.

        At the Hidalgo Palace, Mike meets Isabel and scolds her for concealing the truth from him. A shootout quickly ensues between AMMO and Isabel's men. Marcus shoots the pilot of Isabel's support helicopter, causing it to crash into the central
        lobby and starting a fire. Marcus confronts Isabel, while Mike tries to explain the truth to Armando. Armando begins to beat up Mike, but he refuses to retaliate. Demanding the truth from his mother, Isabel confirms to Armando that Mike is
        his father. Realizing the task he spent a lifetime training for was a lie, Armando tries to protect his father, leading to Isabel inadvertently shooting Armando in the chest while aiming for Mike. Enraged, she attempts to finish Mike, but
        Rita intervenes and shoots Isabel, sending her falling into the flames below.

        Sometime later, Rita has been promoted to police Captain, while Mike and Marcus are placed in charge of AMMO. Mike visits a remorseful Armando in prison, offering him a chance to earn some redemption, which he accepts.

        <u><b>development</b></u> Michael Bay, the director of the first two Bad Boys films, stated in June 2008 that he might direct Bad Boys 3, but that the greatest obstacle would be cost considering both Will Smith and himself demanded some of
        the highest salaries in the film industry.[15] By August 2009, Columbia Pictures had hired Peter Craig to write a script for the sequel.[16] In February 2011, Martin Lawrence stated that the film was in development.[17]

        Following several delays, Jerry Bruckheimer announced in June 2014 that screenwriter David Guggenheim was working on the storyline for the sequel.[18] Two months later, Lawrence said a script had been written and roles had been cast.[19] The
        following year in June 2015, it was reported that director Joe Carnahan was in early talks to write and possibly direct the film.[20] Sony Pictures Entertainment announced a short time later in August 2015 that there were plans for two
        sequels, with Bad Boys 3 scheduled for release on February 17, 2017, followed by Bad Boys 4 on July 3, 2019.[21] In early 2016, Bad Boys 3 was pushed to June 2, 2017, with no update on the release date of Bad Boys 4.[22] Producers had planned
        to begin production in early 2017.[23] Another delay surfaced in August 2016, when, to avoid competition with the upcoming DC Comics film Wonder Woman, the studio pushed the film's release to January 12, 2018.[24] It was also revealed that
        the film would be titled Bad Boys for Life.[24] In an October 2016 interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Lawrence said filming might begin in March 2017.[25] In December 2016, an updated release date for Bad Boys 4 was set for May 24, 2019.[26]

        Sony announced in February 2017 that the film's release would be delayed for a third time to November 9, 2018.[27] The following month, Carnahan left the movie due to scheduling conflicts.[28] In August 2017, Sony removed the third film from
        their release schedule, and later in the month Lawrence said the film would not happen.[29]

        Planning resumed in February 2018 as Belgian directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah were signed in place of Carnahan, and Smith and Lawrence were confirmed to reprise.[30] Geek Worldwide reported that the third installment in the Bad Boys
        franchise would film from November 2018 to March 2019 in Miami and Atlanta, with the release date scheduled for January 17, 2020.[31][32]
